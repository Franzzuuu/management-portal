# Analytics Dashboard - Final Implementation Summary

## ✅ ALL REQUIREMENTS COMPLETED

### A) ✅ Global Chart & Data Rules

- **Monthly Access Trends Removed**: Completely eliminated from UI, data fetching, and imports
- **24-hour Format Everywhere**: All time displays use HH:00 format consistently
- **No null:00 Outputs**: Backend provides valid hour_label, frontend renders "No data" as fallback
- **Faculty as Category**: "Faculty" stays in designation distribution dataset with #4E7D57 styling

### B) ✅ Remove Auto-Refresh UI

- **Auto-refresh Checkbox Removed**: No 30s auto-refresh functionality
- **Refresh Button Removed**: No manual refresh buttons in Quick Filters
- **Data Refresh Logic**: Only refreshes when switching filters, navigating, or after CRUD operations

### C) ✅ Quick Filters (Full Preset Behavior)

**All 8 Presets Implemented** with proper Asia/Manila timezone (+08:00) handling:

- ✅ All Time
- ✅ Today
- ✅ Yesterday
- ✅ This Week
- ✅ Last Week
- ✅ This Month
- ✅ Last Month
- ✅ Last 30 Days

**Implementation Details:**

- PHT calculations in frontend (`date-filters.js`)
- UTC conversion for SQL queries
- "All Time" removes timestamp bounds in backend
- Reusable helper controls all filter range calculations

### D) ✅ Access Patterns Chart Requirements

**Chart Specifications:**

- **Name**: "Daily Access Patterns"
- **X-axis**: Time in HH:00 (24 points: 00:00 through 23:00)
- **Y-axis**: Total number of access logs
- **Series**: Entries (green #355E3B) and Exits (gold #FFD700)
- **Dataset**: Always includes 00–23 with zero-fill for missing hours

**Features:**

- ✅ Smooth line chart with tension: 0.1
- ✅ Tooltips enabled
- ✅ Responsive scaling
- ✅ 24-hour CTE/zero-fill SQL approach

### E) ✅ Peak Hour Metrics Cards (Entry + Exit)

**Updated SQL Queries:**

```sql
SELECT
  HOUR(CONVERT_TZ(al.timestamp, '+00:00', '+08:00')) AS hour_24h,
  DATE_FORMAT(CONVERT_TZ(al.timestamp, '+00:00', '+08:00'), '%H:00') AS hour_label,
  COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM access_logs AS al
WHERE al.entry_type = 'entry' AND [date_filter]
GROUP BY hour_24h, hour_label
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Frontend Handling:**

```javascript
const timeText = data?.hour_label ?? "No data";
const count = data?.cnt ?? 0;
```

**Results:**

- ✅ Returns hour_label as HH:00 format
- ✅ No null hours ever displayed
- ✅ Shows "No data" and 0 when unavailable

### F) ✅ Metrics Cards Icon Styling Fix

**Before**: White backgrounds behind icons causing visual issues
**After**: Transparent or tinted halos

**Implementation:**

```javascript
// Entry card - light green halo
<span className="inline-flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-[#EAF3EC]">
  <svg className="h-6 w-6 text-[#355E3B]" />
</span>

// Exit card - green tinted halo
<span className="inline-flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-[#355E3B] bg-opacity-20">
  <svg className="h-6 w-6 text-[#355E3B]" />
</span>

// Other cards - subtle white halo
<span className="inline-flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-white bg-opacity-20">
  <svg className="h-6 w-6 text-white" />
</span>
```

### G) ✅ User Designation Distribution

**Maintained Categories**: Student, Faculty, Staff, etc. as separate data points
**Faculty Styling**: Specifically styled with #4E7D57 (lighter hunter green)
**Custom Rendering**: Per-point styling based on designation

**SQL Query** (unchanged):

```sql
SELECT u.designation, COUNT(*) AS total_users
FROM users u
GROUP BY u.designation
ORDER BY total_users DESC;
```

**Frontend Logic**:

```javascript
const userDistribution = data.userDistribution?.map((item) => ({
  label: item.designation || "Unknown",
  value: parseInt(item.total_users) || 0,
  color: item.designation === "Faculty" ? "#4E7D57" : undefined,
}));
```

## 📁 Files Modified

### New Files Created:

- `/src/lib/date-filters.js` - Date range calculation utility

### Files Updated:

- `/src/app/api/analytics/route.js` - Enhanced API with date filtering, fixed peak hour queries, 24-hour CTE
- `/src/app/components/DashboardAnalytics.js` - Complete rewrite with all requirements

## 🗄️ Database Queries

### Peak Hour Queries (Fixed)

```sql
-- Entry Peak Hour
SELECT
  HOUR(CONVERT_TZ(al.timestamp, '+00:00', '+08:00')) AS hour_24h,
  DATE_FORMAT(CONVERT_TZ(al.timestamp, '+00:00', '+08:00'), '%H:00') AS hour_label,
  COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM access_logs AS al
WHERE al.entry_type = 'entry'
  AND al.timestamp >= ? AND al.timestamp <= ?
GROUP BY hour_24h, hour_label
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Exit Peak Hour (same structure)
```

### Access Patterns (24-Hour Zero-Fill)

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE hours AS (
    SELECT 0 AS hour
    UNION ALL
    SELECT hour + 1 FROM hours WHERE hour < 23
)
SELECT
    h.hour,
    CONCAT(LPAD(h.hour, 2, '0'), ':00') AS hour_label,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN al.entry_type = 'entry' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS entry_count,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN al.entry_type = 'exit' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS exit_count
FROM hours h
LEFT JOIN access_logs al ON h.hour = HOUR(CONVERT_TZ(al.timestamp, '+00:00', '+08:00'))
    AND al.timestamp >= ? AND al.timestamp <= ?
GROUP BY h.hour, hour_label
ORDER BY h.hour;
```

### User Distribution (Faculty Styling)

```sql
SELECT u.designation, COUNT(*) AS total_users
FROM users u
GROUP BY u.designation
ORDER BY total_users DESC;
```
